After weeks of hard work, we're happy to finally publicly announce AstroFi, our brand-new DeFi platform.

# What is AstroFi?

AstroFi provides a suite of DeFi tools designed to be easy for developers to integrate into their own apps. This is intended to accelerate the development of other innovative DeFi projects.

This will be especially useful to projects with an already large scope or only a small team.

# Who controls AstroFi?

AstroFi aims to be fully decentralized and trustless, that means it won't be controlled by any one owner. Instead it will be governed via a system of _decentralized governance_.

In decentralized governance, the holders of a certain cryptocurrency can vote on proposals. Each unit of the cryptocurrency token represents a single vote.

The cryptocurrency used for our governance will be the *XAI Governance & Utility Token*. It will be responsible, among other things, for controlling every smart contract of the AstroFi project.
